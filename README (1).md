# 🧠 Cracking the Market Code: AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

This project explores the use of AI and time series analysis techniques to predict stock prices. Leveraging historical market data and sentiment analysis, it demonstrates how machine learning models can provide insights into future price movements.

## 📈 Project Overview

The stock market is influenced by numerous factors—some deterministic, others unpredictable. This repository provides a practical approach to forecasting stock prices using:
- Historical stock price data
- Technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI)
- Sentiment scores derived from market news or social media
- AI models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or ARIMA

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ai_stock_prediction_data.csv` | Sample dataset containing historical stock prices with sentiment and technical indicators |
| `notebook.ipynb` (optional) | Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation |
| `model.py` (optional) | Python script to train and evaluate an LSTM model |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |
| `requirements.txt` | List of dependencies for the project |

## 📊 Dataset Description

The CSV file includes the following columns:
- `Date`: Trading date
- `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`: Stock prices
- `Volume`: Trading volume
- `SentimentScore`: NLP-based sentiment analysis score
- `MovingAvg_5d`: 5-day moving average of the closing price
- `RSI_14d`: 14-day Relative Strength Index

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalization and handling missing values
   - Feature engineering with technical indicators

2. **Modeling**
   - Time series forecasting using LSTM or traditional models like ARIMA
   - Optionally incorporate sentiment data for hybrid modeling

3. **Evaluation**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and visualization of predictions

## 🛠 Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ✅ Goals

- Predict short-term stock price movements
- Integrate technical and sentiment-based features
- Visualize trends and evaluate model accuracy

## 📌 Future Work

- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
- Incorporate real-time sentiment from news APIs or social media
- Train with more diverse stock datasets
